kindle-highlights
============

*Get your Kindle highlights via Amazon's Kindle site*

There's currently no Kindle API, so I built a scraper.

**Required gems**

* Mechanize

**Install**
	
	gem install kindle-highlights
**Use**

	require 'kindle-highlights'

	# to create a new KindleHighlight object, give it your Amazon email address and password	
	kindle = KindleHighlight.new("foo@bar.com", "password")
	
	kindle.highlights.each do |highlight|
		highlight.annotation_id # => a unique value for each highlight, generated by Amazon
		highlight.content # => the actual highlight text
		highlight.asin # => the Amazon ASIN for the highlight's product
		highlight.author # => author of the book from which the highlight is taken
		highlight.title # => title of the book from which the highlight is taken
	end

**Use (with v0.06)**

	require 'kindle-highlights'

	# to create a new KindleHighlight object, give it your Amazon email address and password
	kindle = KindleHighlight.new("foo@bar.com", "password", { :page_limit => 100, :wait_time => 2 }) do | h |
		puts "loading... [#{h.books.last.title}]"
	end

	File.open("out.xml", "w") do | f |
		f.puts kindle.to_xml
	end

**Output (with v0.06)**
XML output example

	<?xml version="1.0"?>
	<books>
		<book>
			<asin>ASIN</asin>
			<title>TITLE</title>
			<author>AUTHOR</author>
			<highlights>
				<annotation_id>ANNOTATION_ID1</annotation_id>
				<content>CONTENT1</content>
			</highlights>
			<highlights>
				<annotation_id>ANNOTATION_ID2</annotation_id>
				<content>CONTENT2</content>
			</highlights>
		</book>
	</books>
